# JavaScript-Assesmet

This is an unofficial website about Spain, it has been created by me as part of the javaScript module in the UCDPA Full Stack Software Developer course.

The website consists of a header, with a transparent navigation bar that adopts the blur effect from javaScript to maintain an appropriate contrast, also in mobile devices the navigation bar becomes hamburger-like.
This page allows you to navigate through the different links in the menu or by scrolling to view the different sections, it has an effect of revealing the content from javaScript and the scroll bar has been modified by me to give it a more personal touch.
The body of the web consists of a first section with a button that when clicked imports from javaScrip a youtube video from Spain.info, the video has autoplay and a button to close it if you wish.
Just below the button there are 6 pictures detailing the main aspects, when you hover the mouse over them, they flip over and the relevant content appears.
After that a new section called Society and population appears, when you click on the button, 
javaScript will display the content of the relevant section, where we can find different information about Spain.
In the following section about diversity we can find several pictures of emblematic places and the link to their location in maps, and just below there is a section called Hidden Gems that will show us 20 pictures in an automatic carousel. 
The next section is about history, clicking on the button will import relevant content from javaScript.
And the last section before the footer is a contact form validated from javaScript and a form of valuation of the page, five stars appear that when you pass the mouse over them are marked and when you click on the score remains and opens a box for comments, once sent the comment gives the possibility to return to edit it.
Finally in the footer I have compiled a number of links to official websites that may be of help on a trip to or through Spain, as well as a link to my email and social media icons.
